## modern-art-ui
This is my implementation of the project for the Coursera Programming Mobile Applications for Android course.
There are two main features.
- The main section of the app contains a slider and moving the thumb will cause the colour of the rectangles to gradually change
- The action bar contains an item for more information, which can take the user to MOMA home page
